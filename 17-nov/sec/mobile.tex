	\subsection{Mobile app architecture}
	In this subsection, the decisions regarding the architecture of the mobile app will
	be explained, but not those that regard the user experience of the mobile. This 
	will be explained in more detail at  \ref{sec:views}.\\
	\\
	First, why we chose flutter and not other frameworks, as Android or React Native,
	will be explained. Then, it will be introduced the Redux for the state management
	of the app.\\
	\\
	\subsubsection{Flutter}
	Flutter is a multiplatform framework aiming to become a standard for building apps
	that have to work on either Android and iOS, as well as the web, desktop and embedded 
	operative systems. \\
	\\
	As a tool it has proven that it can build more resilient and optimized apps that its counterparts, 
	as React Native, while still being multiplatform, as React Native. However, it was decided to
	chose this tool against a normal Android application as the team had already some experience
	with it. As a matter of fact, it was chosen to use React for the web counterpart instead of trying 
	to use the same components made for the mobile for the same reason.\\
	\\
	Even if the framework is young, the community behind flutter is active and have active repositories
	that have some application examples, as well as libraries showcase that have and will help
	the development of the app.
	% TODO what the fuck did I just write?
