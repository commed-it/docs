\section{Planification}

\subsection{User Stories}

The first thing that was done regarding the planification of the project
was to define the behavior of the application in a list of user stories.
The next list exposes all of the actions that the user can do with it as
well as different ways of interacting with it.

\subsubsection{Sprint 1}
\begin{itemize}

\item
  \textbf{US1:} As a guest, I want to register in the application
\item
  \textbf{US2:} As a user, I want to log in to the application.
\item
  \textbf{US3:} As a registered user, I want to create a profile of my
  company.
\item
  \textbf{US4:} As a guest, I want to search for services or products so
  that I receive said list.
\item
  \textbf{US5:} As a guest, I want to have a detailed view of the
  product/service.
\item
  \textbf{US6:} As a registered user who has a company profile, I want
  to create services/products.
\item
  \textbf{US7:} As a user, I want to be able to \emph{connect} with a
  company that has made a publication.
\item
  \textbf{US8:} As a user, I need to be able to speak in a chat with the
  company that I connected.
\item
  \textbf{US9:} As a company, I want to respond in the chat with the

\item
  \textbf{US10:} As a company, I want to send a Formal Offer which
  contains a contract as a PDF through the chat.
\item
  \textbf{US11:} As a company, I want to digitally sign contracts.
\item
  \textbf{US12:} As a user, I want to digitally sign contracts.
\item
  \textbf{US13:} As a user, I want to receive evidences of the process
  when a contract is signed.
\item
  \textbf{US14:} As a user, I want to receive billing and invoices
  regarding the signed commercial transaction contract.
\end{itemize}
