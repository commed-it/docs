\section{Planification}

\subsection{User Stories}

The first thing that was done regarding the planification of the project
was to define the behavior of the application in a list of user stories.
The next list exposes all of the actions that the user can do with it as
well as different ways of interacting with it.

\subsubsection{Sprint 1}
\begin{itemize}

\item
  \textbf{US1:} As a guest, I want to register in the application
\item
  \textbf{US2:} As a user, I want to log in to the application.
\item
  \textbf{US3:} As a registered user, I want to create a profile of my
  company.
\item
  \textbf{US4:} As a guest, I want to search for services or products so
