\section{Planification}

\subsection{User Stories}

The first thing that was done regarding the planification of the project
was to define the behavior of the application in a list of user stories.
The next list exposes all of the actions that the user can do with it as
well as different ways of interacting with it.
\\
\\
For this sprint, not only it has been changed the name of the user stories to be more precised but also it has been added new ones, related to the formal offer and financial operations. Although the last ones are not implemented, they do exist in set of user stories.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AUTH1}: As a guest, I want to register in the application 
	\item \textbf{AUTH2}: As a user, I want to log in to the application. 
	\item \textbf{AUTH3}: As a registered user, I want to create a profile of my company.
	\item \textbf{PROD1}: As a guest, I want to search for services or products so that I receive a list of services or products.
	\item \textbf{PROD2}: As a guest, I want to have a detailed view of the product/service.
	\item \textbf{PROD3}: As a registered user who has a company profile, I want to create services/products.
	\item \textbf{CHAT1}: As a user, I want to connect to a company because of a publication.
	\item \textbf{CHAT2}: As a user, I need to chat with the company that I connected with.
	\item \textbf{CHAT3}: As a company, I want to chat with the users that have sent a message.
	\item \textbf{FO1}: As a company, I want to send the Formal Offer which contains the contract pdf through the chat.
	\item \textbf{FO2}: As a company, I want to digitally sign contracts.
	\item \textbf{FO3}: As a user, I want to digitally sign contracts.
	\item \textbf{FO4}. As a company, I want to have a list of my sent formal offers.
	\item \textbf{FIN1}: As Commed, I want to get a 5\% commission on each contract.
	\item \textbf{FIN2}: As a company, I want to publish the first 3 announcements freely.
	\item \textbf{FIN3}: As a company, I want to have the possibility to pay to promote my announcements.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scrum organization and planification}
Afterwards, a meeting was held in order to fulfill the product backlog
with all the tasks that had to be done. These tasks were related to User
Stories, but they were divided so that the product backlog had a small
granularity in the given tasks.
\\
\\
According to the kanban, it has been created a milestone named \textit{Sprint 2}, which groups all the issues from this sprint. Also, as in this sprint will be two new main projects added to the former sprint, which will be the web client and the mobile client application, it has been assigned new labels to sort the different types of issues in every repository:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{wireframe}. The issue is related to the design of the application.
	\item \textbf{web}. The issue is related to the web client.
	\item \textbf{web-dev}. The issue is related to the development of the web.
	\item \textbf{mobile}. The issue is related to the mobile application.
	\item \textbf{mobile-dev}. The issue is related to the development of the mobile application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scrum analytics}
As Github does not support milestones for a group of repositories but for single one, it has been created three different milestones for each project: \texttt{backend}, \texttt{web-client} and \texttt{mobile-app}.
\\
\\
\textbf{backend}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/sprint2-backend.png}
	\caption{Backend Sprint 2 milestone}
\end{figure}
As it can be seen, the backend has only little modifications, that is why the percentage can be smaller even though it has been done all the tasks for this sprint. The task that is still missing is the authorization management of the endpoints called, which will be held on the next sprint.
\\
\\
\textbf{web-client}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/sprint2-web.png}
	\caption{Web client Sprint 2 milestone}
\end{figure}
In regards of the web client, mostly of the tasks are done. The tasks that are not done are depending on issues detected in backend, such as image management and chat. This issues will be postponed to the third sprint, where will be created new issues related to the back.
\\\\
\textbf{mobile-app}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/sprint2-mobile.png}
	\caption{Web client Sprint 2 milestone}
\end{figure}
According to the mobile application, the things that are still in progress or in to do stage are about the integration of the API backend, which were formerly associated with this sprint. However, while iterating for this sprint, we did realize about that and it was considered that the issues of design and architecture were more important to be finished on this sprint.
%Sprint stuff. Commits estatistics, completition of the tasks, number of tasks done, amount of size completed, sprint progression grapic, Backlog...

\section{Main Screens} \label{sec:views}

\subsection{Mobile Application}
%TODO: Mobile Application screens.
\subsubsection{Wireframe}
It can be seen in the next images the main screens of the wireframe. At first, it can be seen a list of product
as the main page of the application, in the image \ref{fig:wire-1}. The next image \ref{fig:wire-2} contains the login screen, which can be accessed by clicking on the user icon the image before. The register \ref{fig:wire-3} is accessed by clicking at the sign-up option.\\
\\
The image \ref{fig:wire-4} contains the list of chats that you currently have for every product or service, and the \ref{fig:wire-5} has the detail of a particular chat, that can be seen when clicking in a item from the list of chats. The next image contains the list of formal offers \ref{fig:wire-6}. Both lists can be accessed when clicking on the icon in the bottom menu if the application.\\
\\
The last two images contains the detail of an enterprise \ref{fig:wire-7} and a submenu for things related to the user \ref{fig:wire-8}. The first image can be accessed when clicking the logo of an enterprise, and the last one can be seen when clicking on the user logo.

	\label{fig:wire-8}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Application}
In this section, you will encounter all the screens that the application has currently. The first three images correspond to the home, which lists some products, the list of chats, and the list of formal offers. This can be accessed when clicking at the bottom view. It can not be slides, as it was found confusing when using the images' carousel.\\
\\
The next page \ref{fig:mobile-screen-5} is the profile of an enterprise, which is triggered when clicking a logo of the enterprise, in the pages before. In the figure \ref{fig:mobile-screen-4}, the chat between two users can be seen. It also can be seen a formal offer version, and although a formal offer version can only be send by the owner of the product, it was though that showcasing both items in the mock would be better. The next image \ref{fig:mobile-screen-3} is the searcher of the app, that can be triggered when clicking the magnifying  glass icon. It has the history of the items searched, which can be deleted when clicking the trash button, or replicated when clicking the text.\\
\\
Finally, in the images \ref{fig:mobile-screen-2}, \ref{fig:mobile-screen-1}, it is shown the registration and the login screens.
